wsl ./producer_consumer

Great! Since you've opened a Linux terminal (WSL), you can now run the producer-consumer program directly. Here are the simple commands:

## **Step 1: Navigate to your project directory**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/Marwa/Documents/os
```

## **Step 2: Compile the program**
```bash
make
```

## **Step 3: Run the program**
```bash
./producer_consumer
```

## **Or do it all in one command:**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/Marwa/Documents/os && make && ./producer_consumer
```

## **Alternative: Direct compilation**
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -pthread -o producer_consumer producer_consumer.c
./producer_consumer
```

The program will:
- Generate 10,000 random numbers (0-1000)
- Display consumer activities on screen
- Create `Producer_activity.txt` and `Consumer_activity.txt` files
- Show synchronization between producer and consumer threads

Just run these commands in your Linux terminal and the program will execute perfectly!
